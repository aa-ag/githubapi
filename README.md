# Github's Api

Playing around with Github's [API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).

### reason

previous laptop went kaput (currently at the shop), and while everything important is backedup/pushed to github, wanted to practice creating a script that would:

- hit api's endpoints and 
- clone all repos locally
